# haarpsi-pytorch
This is a Python PyTorch implementation of the HaarPSI algorithm as presented in "A Haar wavelet-based perceptual similarity index for image quality assessment" by Rafael Reisenhofer, Sebastian Bosse, Gitta Kutyniok and Thomas Wiegand.

Converted by SÃ¶ren Dittmer and Clemens Karner from the original Python tensorflow implementation written by David Neumann and from the original MATLAB implementation written by Rafael Reisenhofer.

Please note that this implementation requires images scaled to [0,1], while the original implementation expects images with image values in [0,255].
